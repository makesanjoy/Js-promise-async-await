                                       PROMISE
Promise object is a placeholder for a certain value of time until we receive a value from an asynchronous operation
promise are useful in handling async function
We can assume promise to be an empty object with some data value init and this data value will hold what ever will be returned

we are passing this callback function to another function
in this we don't know when will this callback function will be called and how many times will it be called we cannot gurantee it
and here we are attaching callback to a promise object
In this we know that the callback will be only called when the promise has a data in the promise object and it will call only once so here we are also having control of the code
there's a different between passing a callback and attaching a callback
